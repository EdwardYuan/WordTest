WordTest
========

A GRE wordtest app 

I'm prepare my GRE test && I didn't find a good word test app on Linux, some web apps are good, but
the range is not match with the words I read everyday, thus, I wrote this simple app, anyone can modify and distribute it under GPL v2 license.
I start it last night, there are much BUGS, be caution with them.

INSTRUCTION:
	The Icon images are found on web, I don't know who are designers, so if anyone who will design a new icon, do it and thank u.
