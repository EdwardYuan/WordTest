WordTest
========

A GRE wordtest app 

I'm prepare my GRE test && I didn't find a word test app on Linux which could sastify my requarment, some web apps are good,such as Shanbey, but
the range is not match the words I read everyday, thus, I wrote this simple app, anyone can modify and distribute it under GPL v2 license.
I start it last night, there are much BUGS, be careful with them.

INSTRUCTION:
	The Icon images are found on web, I don't know who are designers, so if anyone who will design a new icon, do it and thank u.
